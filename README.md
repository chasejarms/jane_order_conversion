This file takes a detailed jane.com shipping file (.csv)
and converts it into a stamps.com shipping file that you
can upload using the browser.

Additionally, the file adds size (abbreviated) and color
information to every shipping label to reduce errors
during the shipping process.

IMPORTANT: Please note that after running the script with
the terminal, you'll need to go into the CSV file and add
in the ounces for each product. On each row, you'll see
the letters 'OZ' and you'll edit this with the product
weight. This is done because jane does not provide the
ounces in their csv file.
